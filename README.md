# AAC-profile-in-Cantonese-using-LetMeTalk-App

Purpose:  i) to build up a library of pictures suitable for Aphasia clients;  ii) attract users to contribute and evolve to a proven library
iii) to invite ideas in introducing basic elements in PECS to reinforce communication (e.g. through the initiate, reach, and release cycle)

Scope:  i) to elderly adult with aphasia due to stroke or alzhemeir,  ii) in Cantonese language,

## Running
Running requires installation of:
i) install LetMeTalk app (http://www.letmetalk.info),
ii) download a text-to-speech utility for Cantonese (tts), say EKHO (http://www.eguidedog.net/ekho.php)  

Both can be successfully downloaded from google play for Android device.  

the above apps can be downloaded to windows PC.  But before installation you may need to install bluestacks, the emulator for using android on Windows PC
(http://www.bluestacks.com/#gref).  Once the bluestacks is installed you may use google play on the windows PC.

The experience of using a larger screen in PC is much better than using the smartphone and considered a preference for elderly. 

The LetMeTalk and ekho tts are free to download.  please give donations to the organisation if you find the apps useful.

## Using the profile

i) install letMeTalk 

ii) install ekho tts, 

iii) run the LetMeTalk use ehko as the preferred tts.  Now you can use LetMeTalk in cantonese

iv) download the profile as attached to this github project to the device (LetMeTalkForThinkMostSimpleWithMaskedPic.lmtbackup), via bluetooth or via email,

v) open the profile file and when asked to which application to open with, select LetMeTalk.  the LetMeTalk app will import the 
cantonese profile.

vi) Within LetMeTalk load the profile, namely LetMeTalkForThinkMostSimpleWithMaskedPic

vii) add your picture and photos as particular and suitable to the user.  Photos familiar to the user, even food and drink token with camera are better than 
cartonist pictures.  Don't overload the additions of pictures.  Start with a few and add/delete pictures from the profile.

viii) use the PECS methodology to practice with the user (http://www.pecsusa.com/).   The key is to start acquire the skill before actually use the app, may be with a few 
picture cards and exchange for communications.  slow down and distinguish the communication steps in four:  
a) wait for initiation from user to talk (or with an additional helper standing behind to give encourange or hint),
b) pick up the card and reach to the audience,
c) release to the audience,
d) the audience pick up the card as LISTENING and give action to complete and re-inforce the communication.

ix) after acquiring the skill, practice with the LetMeTalk app.  the tablet or smartphone can be exchanged and sentence can be spoken/repeated as a gesture 
to receive the message by the listener.

x) as everyone is different in aphasia, especially on the cognitive ability of individual could limit the acquistion and use of the skill, improvise as 
communication take place or try again when fail.
